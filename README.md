## Mobile Content Transfer
This example application demonstrates how you can use the [Global Input App library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to implement [Content transfer](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-content-transfer) on a device application so users can transfer content from their mobile devices to the device that is running your application. The communication between the mobile and your application is secured with end-to-end encryption. 

### How to Run

```
   git clone  https://github.com/global-input/content-transfer-example.git
   cd content-transfer-example  
   npm install
   npm start
```
